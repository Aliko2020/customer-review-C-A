Customer Testimonials Website
This project allows customers to leave testimonials and reviews for products they've purchased. The website features a form for customers to submit their reviews, as well as a section displaying customer testimonials. The reviews are paginated and submitted to a backend server (though the backend part is not implemented here).

The website also includes a popup notification that appears when a review is successfully submitted.

Pagination: Reviews are paginated with options to navigate between pages.

Popup Notification: Displays a confirmation message when a review is submitted successfully.

Responsive Design: The website is responsive and works on desktop and mobile devices.
